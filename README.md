## s3_upload.rb
I have a Jekyll built blog that used to be hosted on Github. When I moved it to S3, I needed to find a simple way to upload it to S3. https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website does this, but I wanted something simple (not to mention, I don't want to install Java). Hence, this script was created. Just modify the s3_upload_config values, and run. It's nice and simple.

## nph-antileech.cgi
Perl script created in 1998 to throttle downloads for a video sharing site.
